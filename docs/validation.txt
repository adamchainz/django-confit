Validate schemas
################

**As a Django user**, once you have :doc:`loaded configuration <loaders>`, you
want to make sure it is valid. It is a must-have feature when the configuration
comes from various locations. Or when it has been written by several users.

**As a non Django user** (such as a member of the Ops team, who deploys and
configure services), you do **not** want to be prosecuted because you made a
typo in configuration. You think applications should validate the configuration
before they actually use it, and report errors with a readable output.

This section explains how `django-confit` helps Django users validate
configuration.
