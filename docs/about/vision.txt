`django-confit` has been created with the following concepts in mind:

* Local configuration should not live in code. Altering ``sys.path`` or putting
  local settings module within code is not a good practice. Moreover, code
  should not vary from one environment to another.

* Environment variables are not enough to manage settings. You can load
  settings from environment variables, but you can also do it from files. Files
  have many benefits (backup, version control...).

* Settings imported from external locations should be validated.

* Application should expose the full list of settings they use.

* Documentation about applications settings should be auto-generated.
